The Collexpander WordPress plugin allows you to hide or show selected text content dynamically with a toggle button.



== Description ==
The Collexpander WordPress plugin allows you to hide or show selected text content dynamically with a toggle button.
It’s useful when you want to display long descriptions, FAQs, technical documentation, or additional product details without overwhelming the reader.

Simply insert the shortcode pair in your post or page:

[collexpander-show-content]
    <!-- Your collapsible content here -->
[collexpander-hide-content]

Everything placed between the two shortcodes will be initially hidden, and can be expanded or collapsed when the visitor clicks the toggle button.

The plugin includes three customizable button styles (default, outline, and minimal) and two button text options (e.g., “Show” / “Hide” or “More” / “Less”).
You can also easily adjust button labels, colors.

This plugin helps improve content readability and provides a clean, user-friendly experience — ideal for blogs, product pages, FAQs, and educational content where text organization and clarity matter.
